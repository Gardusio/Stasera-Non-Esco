Brief description:

	Simple mobile app to manage incoming delivery-orders.
	
	The shop (Stasera Non Esco) is actually searching for someone to implement an orders management system. This repo contains a first demo-proposal for them.
	
	
Tech-spech:

	Cross-platform mobile-app written in C# using Xamarin framework. 
	
	Because of the app being really simple in its logic, no use of MVVM or other particular pattern has been made.
	
	The application back-end is written in C# using .NET CORE and Entity Framework Core. The Mobile-App consumes the REST API service that it expose.
	
	
	You can find the back-end here: https://github.com/Gardusio/Ecommerce-Api
